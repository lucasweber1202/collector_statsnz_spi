"""Tell a new official release apart from a rerun, a revision or a broken layout.

The evidence is the source's own: the publication date it states for the file
(``metadata.last_publish_date``) and the latest period the file covers. Both are
compared with what the database already holds *before* this run writes, and the
number of rows this run actually changed tells a silent revision from a no-op.
The run date is never evidence: running twice on different days against the
same release is ``same_release``.

Statuses:

* ``first_release`` -- nothing from this source is stored yet;
* ``new_release`` -- the publication date advanced (or, for a source without
  one, the latest covered period advanced);
* ``revised_source`` -- same publication, but stored values changed or were
  added: the publisher replaced the file without a new release;
* ``same_release`` -- same publication, nothing changed;
* ``layout_changed`` -- the file failed its audited layout checks; set by
  ``main.py`` when extraction raises ``SourceLayoutError``, before any write.

A publication date that goes backwards fails the run: it means discovery picked
the wrong release, and writing it would move ``last_publish_date`` back in time.
